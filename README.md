# OSRE - Just another Open-Source-Render-Engine

This is just another open-source render engine / game engine made by Kim Kulling. This is a playground project for me to work on my side projects.
Don't expect too much, I will not invest too much time into it. But If you are interested in playing around with 3D stuff feel free to discuss 
these things on Reggit or in the Discussion Forum.
